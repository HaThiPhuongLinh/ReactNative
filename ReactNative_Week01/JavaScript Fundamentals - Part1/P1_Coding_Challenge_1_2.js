/*
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter).

/*
Test data:
ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
m tall.
ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
m tall.

// 2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both versions)
var MarkBMI = MarkMass / MarkHeight ** 2;

// 3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
